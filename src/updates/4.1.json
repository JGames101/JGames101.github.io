    "body":"In version 3.0, a feature was added to allow for faster page transitions, using the modular design from version 2.0 to load in pages without reloading assets. That has been reintroduced in this version, with some major changes:<br><h2>Loading the Content</h2>In version 3.0, like in every version since 2.0, the content of a page has been laoded from its own html file, in the \"page\" folder. This file was seperate from the index.html file, which meant that to prevent having to duplicate changes, the index files just said \"Loading...\". Now, instead of loading a seperate HTML file, the same file as usual is loaded. There is then code that gets only the content portion of that file, and overwrites the old content with it.<br>This new way of loading information is benefitial for one big reason: the page still works without JavaScript. That means that search engines can still perfectly navigate the site. Before, search engines looking into the page couldn't see any content, and could only see the toolbar. Now, search engines can see the full page, including links to other pages.<h2>Pushstate and Popstate</h2>Pushstate was used in version 3.0 to set the url, and this worked perfectly. However, Popstate was meant to be used both the close the article reader and to change the page. It didn't work, though, Because each pushstate happened too many times. In this version, each pushstate only happens once, so it works properly.<h2>Update Dialog</h2>In the epsilon update, there was a dialog that appeared if you had not used the Epsilon update before, saying that there has been a redesign. Now, in this version, if you have used the Epsilon Update before, but not the latest version, then this dialog will appear, listing all updates since the user last visited."
