    "body":"<img width='100%' src='/media/screenshot/history/Epsilon.2.png'>Epsilon 4.2 adds two new major features: one intended for Epsilon, and on originally intended for delta, being partly implemented. These features are a searchbox, and an apps button.<h2>Apps List</h2>The apps list contains a link to different applications on the site, currently linking to the main site, notebook, and nth-frame. These are considered useful enough to be apps, rather than tests or experiments.<h2>Search</h2>The searchbar was originally intended for Delta. In the code in the later versions, there is a searchbar, that is hidden, unless you have a flag enabled in options. Even then, it still didn't have any function. After version 4.1, though, that brings in the pages by getting certain parts of other pages, this version uses a similar concept to look inside pages, and look for matches to the text. This works by looking for cards that contain the text from the query. This works for the updates page, the code page, and the media page.<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>There are a few hidden changes in this version, such as the new sitemap for betting listing on search engines like Google."
