                    The PiP video player is fully functional!
                    The site now uses CSS grid for a better experience with screen readers, to make the flow of the HTML document make more sense, and to make resizing the page function properly.
                    The card sorting system from <a href="#1.43">v1.43 Beta</a> has been replaced with CSS Grid.

                    The menu has been replaced by a bar. You can click the expand button to open it,
                    and it will appear similar to the menu from <a href="#0.8">v0.8</a>, but with icons at the left.
                    When not expanded, the icons remain on the left, being clickable.
                    All pages now have a viewport, so no pages will face the angular issue of being too small on mobile.
                    Updated theme colour for Android.
                    There's now a custom scrollbar!

                    New site design, with a background image! Added an early test of a photo gallery.
                    Added Berlin VR to the homefeed. Removed responsive and offline pages, as the entire
                    site does that. There's now a darkened background under cards on PC and tablet.
                    There's now a global.js file for hiding the JS alert. Pages have moved to subfolders.
                    e.g. "updates.html" becomes "/updates".
